# CS50

I have completed CS50, which is an introductory Computer Science course taught by Harvard University.

Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML.

#### Week 0 Scratch

What is:
- Computer Science
- Binary
- Algorithms 

#### Week 1 C
- Data types: string, types, formats, operators
- Memory

#### Week 2 Arrays
- Compiling
- Debugging
- Data Types
- Arrays
- Comamnd-line arguments

#### Week 3 Algorithms
- Linear search: checks each element sequentially
- Binary search: compares the target value to the middle element of the array
- Big O: describes how fast a function is growing. It is used in CS when estimating time complexity
- Bubble sort: The largest number bubbles to the right. O(n2). Nested for loops. 
- Selection sort: repeatedly finding the minimum element from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. O(n2) 
- Insertion sort: Compare two values next to each other and insert the smaller value into its position earlier in the array. o(n2) worst.
- Merge sort: It divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves. O(n log n)

#### Week 4 Memory
- Pointers

#### Week 5 Data Structures
- Linked lists
- Tree
- queue: abstract data structure: add values and remove values in a first-in-first-out way. 
- stack: most recently added are removed first. Last-in-first-out
- dictionary: map keys to values

#### Week 6 Python
- Python basics

#### Week 7 SQL

#### Week 8 Information
- Privacy
